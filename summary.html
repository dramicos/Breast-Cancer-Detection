            <h3>Our best performing model was Neural Network which had a Test Score of 97.74%</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>To achieve this score we loaded the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook and cleaned the data so that diagnosis was no longer categorical and dropped the ID column.</p>
            <p>We took a look at the data through a histogram to observe whether or not the data was evenly distiubuted as this would hamper certain models.</p>
            <img src="images/histogram_map.jpg">
            <p>A strong right skew was observed which told us that for some models tweaks to the data would be needed for them to run effciently.</p>
            <p>Another issue was that when we looked at the difference between benign and malignant in some there was either a lot of overlap or very little.</p>
            <div>
              <img src="images/perimeter_mean.png" alt="Perimeter Mean">
              <img src="images/smoothness_mean.png" alt="Smoothness Mean">
              <img src="images/texture_mean.png" alt="Texture Mean">
              <img src="images/radius_mean.png" alt="Radius Mean">
            </div>
            <p>We then split the data into 3 seperate dataframes that could be tested for different results.</p>
            <p>The first was our whole dataframe with no tweaks made as the control.</p>
            <p>The second was a dataframe that had just as many benigns as malignants to see if an even training and test would make for better results.</p>
            <p>The third was a dataframe skewed towards malignant to see if we could reduce False Negatives.</p>
            <p>The datasets were then split into their training and testing splits and a MinMax Scaler was used as all our values were more than 0.</p>
            <p>We ran through the models and found that our top performers tended to be Random Forest Classifiers, Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression.</p>
            <p>A confusion matrix was ran on these models to help reduce the amount of False Negatives,
              the False Negative rate for Random Forest Classifiers was 3%, the False Negative rate for the Neural Network was .65%, and the False Negative rate for the Logistic Regression was 3%.
            </p>
            <p>The Neural Network also had a slightly higher accuracy of 97.74% compared to the 97.18% of the Random Forest Classifier.</p>
            <p>In conclusion we think that a Neural Network that has been properly tuned and biased towards elimanating False Negatives would be the most useful for Breast Cancer detection in tumors.</p>
